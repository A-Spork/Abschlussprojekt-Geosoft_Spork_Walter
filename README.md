# Abschlussprojekt-Geosoft_Spork_Walter
A node/mongodb based version of a corona app
 
To use the full potential of this app, the tokens for the following APIs are needed:
- LocationIQ: forward Geocoding, https://locationiq.com/docs#search-forward-geocoding
- here: Development: Public Transit API (8.0.0), https://developer.here.com/documentation/public-transit/api-reference-swagger.html
For full functionality of the tests its necassary to insert the key for the Geocoding Api (/public/test.js - line 32)
 
To start the app use npm start or docker composeup.
Then open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser
There you can sign or log in. To save a tour go to "Add A Tour", set the position and click at the map to choose the busstop. Choose the tour in the table below and save it. 
To view your tours go to "View your tours".
When loging in after one of your tours was marked you will get a message at the welcomepage (Only once).
 
Below is not ment for public use:
To manage your patients tours as a doctor, log in with username: doc, password: doc, or go to http://localhost:3000/public/doc.html and insert the patientsÂ´s username and a timeperiod
To test the functions and check if the API is available (key needs to be inserted) go to "Test" or log in with username: test, password: test or go to http://localhost:3000/public/test.html
To see all registered users or if you forgot your password log in with username: admin, password: admin and you see all users at the server console
